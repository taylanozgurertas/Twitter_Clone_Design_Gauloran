# twitter_clone

It's simple twitter clone and it helped me to understand some Flutter widgets like TabBar and ListView, Card etc.

##Structure

lib
 custom
 home
 model

I created a custom refresh2.dart file which includes a custom RefreshIndicator from core. We doesn't need any package to provide that refresh indicator skill just can come with refresh2.dart file that I created.
I tried to slice the code a lot of parts like

Widget get _footerButtonList => ... 
Widget get _someAnotherThing => ... etc.

I will try to add some another features. We will see what is going to happen next.
